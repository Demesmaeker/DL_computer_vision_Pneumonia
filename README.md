# DL_computer_vision_Pneumonia
BeCode's Challenge : design a CNN capable of recognising pneumonia in x-rays of patients


### Who
For this challnge, we were 2 :
- [Maxime Dropsy](https://github.com/MDropsy) 
- [Morgane Demesmaeker](https://github.com/Demesmaeker) 


### Objectives
##### Must-have features
- A CNN trained that can recognise new images outside of the training set
- Proper model evaluation (split dataset, confusion matrix, etc)
- Visualisations of model results (properly labeled, titled...)

##### Nice-to-have features
- A visualisation of the feature maps of the model
- Comparison with other CNN model structures


### When
- Deadline: 27/01/2021
- Duration: 2 days


### Where
All the work done was made during the BeCode's AI's formation 2020-2021.


### Preview
